# dockerproj
This project was done to show the simple workings of the docker workflow integrated with CircleCI and python.

In this project, Python image was used as the base image for Docker in the CI/CD pipeline.

And a virtual environment was created to isolate and manage the Python packages for the project. Hadolint was used to lint the docker files to adopt the use of best practices and avoid errors.
